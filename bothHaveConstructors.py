### Constructor: When Parent and child both have constructor
- **Short Explanation:** When both classes have constructors, the child class can call the parent's constructor using `super()`.
- **Practice Problem:** Create a `Parent` class with a constructor, 
and a `Child` class with its own constructor that calls the parentâ€™s constructor.
- **Test Case Output:** 
  - `Child constructor called after Parent constructor`
